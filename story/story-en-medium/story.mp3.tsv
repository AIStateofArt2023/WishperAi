0	4000	Fun-tion Kids!
5000	7000	The use of time.
7000	14000	The person who uses time gets good results with time.
14000	19000	This is what happened when Sonu and Vani's annual exams were about to come.
19000	23000	Are you still studying? Let's have food.
23000	28000	There is just a little project left. If we don't do it, the teacher will scold us.
28000	31000	And exams are also starting from next week.
31000	36000	Vani was a very hardworking and time-consuming child.
36000	41000	Whereas her brother Sonu was a very careless and evil child.
41000	43000	He used to postpone everything.
43000	45000	Did you finish your project?
45000	47000	Yes, I have just finished the project.
47000	49000	That has to be done in the sixth period.
49000	52000	There are still two periods left.
52000	54000	I will do it quickly.
54000	58000	Come soon. I am hungry. And I have to play too.
58000	62000	Sonu, wait. If you don't do it, the teacher will scold you.
62000	68000	Sonu and Vani's parents used to always give Sonu an example of Vani.
68000	71000	Sonu, you have grown up.
71000	75000	Along with playing, you should also pay attention to your studies.
75000	77000	Yes, mom. From tomorrow.
77000	82000	Sonu, learn to use time from your sister.
82000	86000	She studies and plays from time to time.
86000	90000	She never neglects her work from tomorrow.
90000	94000	I will also do the same from tomorrow.
94000	97000	Shall I go to play now? Please.
97000	101000	Sonu's carelessness was increasing day by day.
103000	107000	And finally, the days of exams were nearing.
107000	111000	Only two days were left in Sonu and Vani's exams.
111000	117000	Children, your exams are starting from next Monday.
117000	122000	Study hard and give a good exam.
122000	126000	Sonu, I am very worried about you.
126000	129000	You always neglect your work from tomorrow.
129000	132000	Don't neglect your studies from tomorrow.
132000	136000	Like Vani, study all your studies from time to time. Okay?
136000	141000	Dad, only two days are left in exams.
141000	144000	I will study fast. Everything.
144000	146000	I am going to play now.
146000	150000	Till I don't play, I won't understand my studies.
157000	162000	Vani, look at the beautiful weather.
162000	165000	Come, let's play for a while.
165000	168000	We can study later too.
168000	170000	Everything will be done quickly.
170000	173000	Yes, the weather is nice.
173000	175000	But I have to complete my exams.
175000	177000	Tomorrow is the exam.
177000	180000	Playing in this weather is fun.
180000	182000	You keep studying.
182000	185000	I am going to play.
185000	189000	After some time, Vani saw that the beautiful weather..
189000	192000	..is slowly turning into a storm.
192000	195000	And the dark clouds are disappearing.
195000	198000	Let's assume that it can rain anytime.
198000	202000	Vani was worried about the weather.
202000	206000	If it rains, how will she complete her exams?
206000	210000	Because in the rains, the electricity is cut off.
210000	212000	She called out to Sonu.
212000	214000	Sonu, listen.
214000	217000	Looking at the weather, it seems that it is going to rain.
217000	220000	Maybe the electricity will be cut off at night.
220000	223000	Leave that and come and complete your exams.
223000	225000	Otherwise, what will you write in the exam tomorrow?
225000	227000	Don't worry, Vani.
227000	229000	It is afternoon now.
229000	233000	I will finish everything quickly at night.
233000	235000	The electricity will not go.
235000	239000	But after the rains, it will be more fun to study.
239000	240000	Okay, I am going.
240000	242000	My batting is here.
242000	245000	Sonu kept playing till late evening.
245000	249000	But her worries increased when the rain started.
249000	251000	Sonu was very scared.
251000	252000	And returned home.
252000	258000	Where she saw that there is no electricity in the entire village.
258000	262000	Seeing this, Sonu started crying loudly.
264000	267000	What will happen to me in the exam tomorrow?
267000	270000	I didn't study even once.
270000	272000	And now there is no electricity.
272000	275000	I will fail.
275000	278000	I told you.
278000	280000	Study your studies on time.
280000	283000	I told you a week ago.
283000	285000	Study on time.
285000	288000	But you never understand anything.
288000	290000	Now enjoy.
290000	292000	Sorry, dad.
292000	294000	What do I do now?
294000	299000	I wish I had studied my studies on time.
299000	304000	She understood that due to her carelessness..
304000	307000	..she doesn't have time to study now.
307000	309000	Crying won't do anything now.
309000	313000	Now did you understand why everyone used to make you understand?
313000	315000	Now stop crying.
315000	317000	And come with me.
317000	320000	I just completed my studies on time.
320000	322000	I will explain you the entire lesson.
322000	324000	And I will also remind you.
324000	325000	Come on.
325000	329000	The next day, both the kids went to give their exams.
329000	332000	The one who respects time in the future..
332000	355000	..is called great.
