1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Fun-tion Kids!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The use of time.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The person who uses time gets good results with time.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This is what happened when Sonu and Vani's annual exams were about to come.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Are you still studying? Let's have food.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
There is just a little project left. If we don't do it, the teacher will scold us.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And exams are also starting from next week.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Vani was a very hardworking and time-consuming child.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Whereas her brother Sonu was a very careless and evil child.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
He used to postpone everything.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Did you finish your project?

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yes, I have just finished the project.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That has to be done in the sixth period.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There are still two periods left.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I will do it quickly.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Come soon. I am hungry. And I have to play too.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Sonu, wait. If you don't do it, the teacher will scold you.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Sonu and Vani's parents used to always give Sonu an example of Vani.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Sonu, you have grown up.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Along with playing, you should also pay attention to your studies.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yes, mom. From tomorrow.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Sonu, learn to use time from your sister.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
She studies and plays from time to time.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
She never neglects her work from tomorrow.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I will also do the same from tomorrow.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Shall I go to play now? Please.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Sonu's carelessness was increasing day by day.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And finally, the days of exams were nearing.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Only two days were left in Sonu and Vani's exams.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Children, your exams are starting from next Monday.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Study hard and give a good exam.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Sonu, I am very worried about you.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You always neglect your work from tomorrow.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Don't neglect your studies from tomorrow.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Like Vani, study all your studies from time to time. Okay?

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Dad, only two days are left in exams.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I will study fast. Everything.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I am going to play now.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Till I don't play, I won't understand my studies.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Vani, look at the beautiful weather.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Come, let's play for a while.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We can study later too.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Everything will be done quickly.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yes, the weather is nice.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But I have to complete my exams.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Tomorrow is the exam.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Playing in this weather is fun.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You keep studying.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I am going to play.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
After some time, Vani saw that the beautiful weather..

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
..is slowly turning into a storm.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And the dark clouds are disappearing.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Let's assume that it can rain anytime.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Vani was worried about the weather.

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
If it rains, how will she complete her exams?

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Because in the rains, the electricity is cut off.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
She called out to Sonu.

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Sonu, listen.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Looking at the weather, it seems that it is going to rain.

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Maybe the electricity will be cut off at night.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Leave that and come and complete your exams.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Otherwise, what will you write in the exam tomorrow?

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Don't worry, Vani.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It is afternoon now.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I will finish everything quickly at night.

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The electricity will not go.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But after the rains, it will be more fun to study.

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Okay, I am going.

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
My batting is here.

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Sonu kept playing till late evening.

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But her worries increased when the rain started.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Sonu was very scared.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And returned home.

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Where she saw that there is no electricity in the entire village.

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Seeing this, Sonu started crying loudly.

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What will happen to me in the exam tomorrow?

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I didn't study even once.

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And now there is no electricity.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I will fail.

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I told you.

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Study your studies on time.

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I told you a week ago.

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Study on time.

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But you never understand anything.

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Now enjoy.

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Sorry, dad.

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What do I do now?

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I wish I had studied my studies on time.

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
She understood that due to her carelessness..

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
..she doesn't have time to study now.

91
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Crying won't do anything now.

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Now did you understand why everyone used to make you understand?

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Now stop crying.

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And come with me.

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I just completed my studies on time.

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I will explain you the entire lesson.

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And I will also remind you.

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Come on.

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The next day, both the kids went to give their exams.

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The one who respects time in the future..

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:55,000
..is called great.
