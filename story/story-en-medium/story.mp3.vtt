00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Fun-tion Kids!

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
The use of time.

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
The person who uses time gets good results with time.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
This is what happened when Sonu and Vani's annual exams were about to come.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
Are you still studying? Let's have food.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
There is just a little project left. If we don't do it, the teacher will scold us.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
And exams are also starting from next week.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Vani was a very hardworking and time-consuming child.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
Whereas her brother Sonu was a very careless and evil child.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
He used to postpone everything.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Did you finish your project?

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
Yes, I have just finished the project.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
That has to be done in the sixth period.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
There are still two periods left.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
I will do it quickly.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
Come soon. I am hungry. And I have to play too.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
Sonu, wait. If you don't do it, the teacher will scold you.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
Sonu and Vani's parents used to always give Sonu an example of Vani.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Sonu, you have grown up.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
Along with playing, you should also pay attention to your studies.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Yes, mom. From tomorrow.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
Sonu, learn to use time from your sister.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
She studies and plays from time to time.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
She never neglects her work from tomorrow.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
I will also do the same from tomorrow.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
Shall I go to play now? Please.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
Sonu's carelessness was increasing day by day.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
And finally, the days of exams were nearing.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
Only two days were left in Sonu and Vani's exams.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
Children, your exams are starting from next Monday.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
Study hard and give a good exam.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
Sonu, I am very worried about you.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
You always neglect your work from tomorrow.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Don't neglect your studies from tomorrow.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
Like Vani, study all your studies from time to time. Okay?

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
Dad, only two days are left in exams.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
I will study fast. Everything.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
I am going to play now.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
Till I don't play, I won't understand my studies.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
Vani, look at the beautiful weather.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
Come, let's play for a while.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
We can study later too.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Everything will be done quickly.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Yes, the weather is nice.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
But I have to complete my exams.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Tomorrow is the exam.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Playing in this weather is fun.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
You keep studying.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
I am going to play.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
After some time, Vani saw that the beautiful weather..

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
..is slowly turning into a storm.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
And the dark clouds are disappearing.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
Let's assume that it can rain anytime.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
Vani was worried about the weather.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
If it rains, how will she complete her exams?

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
Because in the rains, the electricity is cut off.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
She called out to Sonu.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Sonu, listen.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Looking at the weather, it seems that it is going to rain.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Maybe the electricity will be cut off at night.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
Leave that and come and complete your exams.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Otherwise, what will you write in the exam tomorrow?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Don't worry, Vani.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
It is afternoon now.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
I will finish everything quickly at night.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
The electricity will not go.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
But after the rains, it will be more fun to study.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Okay, I am going.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
My batting is here.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Sonu kept playing till late evening.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
But her worries increased when the rain started.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Sonu was very scared.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
And returned home.

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
Where she saw that there is no electricity in the entire village.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
Seeing this, Sonu started crying loudly.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
What will happen to me in the exam tomorrow?

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
I didn't study even once.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
And now there is no electricity.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
I will fail.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
I told you.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Study your studies on time.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
I told you a week ago.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Study on time.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
But you never understand anything.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Now enjoy.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Sorry, dad.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
What do I do now?

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
I wish I had studied my studies on time.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
She understood that due to her carelessness..

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
..she doesn't have time to study now.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Crying won't do anything now.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
Now did you understand why everyone used to make you understand?

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Now stop crying.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
And come with me.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
I just completed my studies on time.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
I will explain you the entire lesson.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
And I will also remind you.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Come on.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
The next day, both the kids went to give their exams.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
The one who respects time in the future..

05:32.000 --> 05:55.000
..is called great.
