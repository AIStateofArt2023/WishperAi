0	5000	Funtime Kids
5000	7000	The best use of time
7000	10000	The person who makes the best use of time
10000	14000	gets good results with time
14000	17000	This is what happened when Sonu and Vani's
17000	19000	annual exams were about to come
19000	21000	Hey, are you still studying?
21000	23000	Come, let's eat
23000	25000	Only a small project is left
25000	28000	If we don't do it, the teacher will scold us
28000	31000	And the exams are starting from next week
31000	33000	Vani was a very hardworking
33000	36000	and a good use of time kid
36000	38000	Whereas her brother Sonu
38000	41000	was a very careless and naughty kid
41000	43000	He used to postpone everything
43000	45000	Is your project done?
45000	47000	Yes, the project has to be done
47000	49000	in the 6th period
49000	52000	There are still 2 periods left
52000	54000	I will do it quickly
54000	56000	Now come fast, I am hungry
56000	58000	And I have to play too
58000	60000	Hey Sonu, wait
60000	62000	If you don't do it, the teacher will scold you
62000	64000	Sonu and Vani's parents
64000	66000	always used to give Sonu
66000	68000	an example of Vani and make him understand
68000	71000	Look Sonu, you have grown up now
71000	73000	Along with playing, you should
73000	75000	also concentrate on your studies
75000	77000	Yes mummy, from tomorrow for sure
77000	80000	Sonu, learn to make good use of time
80000	82000	from your sister
82000	84000	Look, she studies with time
84000	86000	She plays with time
86000	88000	She never postpones today's work
88000	90000	for tomorrow
90000	92000	You see, from tomorrow
92000	94000	I will also do the same
94000	96000	Shall I go and play now?
96000	98000	Please!
98000	100000	Sonu's carelessness was increasing
100000	102000	day by day
102000	104000	And finally
104000	106000	the days of the exams
106000	108000	were nearing
108000	110000	Only 2 days were left
110000	112000	for Sonu and Vani's exams
112000	114000	Listen, from next Monday
114000	116000	your exams are starting
116000	118000	right?
118000	120000	Study hard
120000	122000	and do well in the exams
122000	124000	Sonu, I am
124000	126000	really worried about you
126000	128000	You always postpone
128000	130000	today's work for tomorrow
130000	132000	Don't postpone your studies for tomorrow
132000	134000	Like Vani,
134000	136000	study all the lessons on time
136000	138000	Okay?
138000	140000	Papa, there are still 2 days
140000	142000	left for the exams
142000	144000	I will study everything
144000	146000	I am going to play now
146000	148000	Till I don't play
148000	150000	I won't be able to study
158000	160000	Vani, look
160000	162000	what a beautiful weather
162000	164000	Come, let's play
164000	166000	for a while
166000	168000	We can study later
168000	170000	Everything will be done soon
170000	172000	Yes, the weather is beautiful
172000	174000	But I have to
174000	176000	complete my lessons
176000	178000	Tomorrow is the exams
178000	180000	Playing in this weather
180000	182000	is something else
182000	184000	You keep studying
184000	186000	I am going to play
186000	188000	After a while, Vani saw
188000	190000	that the beautiful weather
190000	192000	is slowly taking the form of a storm
192000	194000	And the dark clouds
194000	196000	are swirling
196000	198000	This can happen anytime
198000	200000	Seeing the weather
200000	202000	Vani was worried
202000	204000	that if it rains
204000	206000	how will she complete her lessons
206000	208000	Because in the rains
208000	210000	the electricity of the house
210000	212000	is cut off
212000	214000	She called out to Sonu
214000	216000	Sonu, listen
216000	218000	It looks like it's going to rain
218000	220000	Maybe the electricity will be cut off at night
220000	222000	Stop playing and
222000	224000	come and complete your lessons
224000	226000	What will you write to me?
226000	228000	Don't worry, Vani
228000	230000	It's afternoon now
230000	232000	I will finish everything
232000	234000	at night
234000	236000	The electricity won't be cut off
236000	238000	It will be fun to study
238000	240000	after the rain
240000	242000	I am going now
242000	244000	Sonu played till late evening
244000	246000	But she was worried
246000	248000	when the rain started
248000	250000	Sonu got scared
250000	252000	and returned home
252000	254000	She saw that
254000	256000	there was no electricity
256000	258000	in the entire village
258000	260000	Seeing this
260000	262000	Sonu started crying
264000	266000	What will happen to me
266000	268000	in the exam tomorrow?
268000	270000	I didn't study a single lesson
270000	272000	And now there is no electricity
272000	274000	I will fail
276000	278000	I told you
278000	280000	to study your lessons
280000	282000	on time
282000	284000	I told you a week ago
284000	286000	to study on time
286000	288000	But you never understood
288000	290000	Now suffer
290000	292000	Sorry, Papa
292000	294000	What do I do now?
294000	296000	I wish
296000	298000	I had studied my lessons
298000	300000	on time
302000	304000	She understood
304000	306000	that because of her carelessness
306000	308000	she didn't have time to study
308000	310000	Crying won't help
310000	312000	Now do you understand
312000	314000	why everyone used to explain you?
314000	316000	Now stop crying
316000	318000	and come with me
318000	320000	I had completed my studies
320000	322000	on time
322000	324000	I will teach you all the lessons
324000	326000	and remind you
326000	328000	The next day
328000	330000	both the children went to the exam
330000	332000	The one who respects time
332000	334000	in the future
334000	338000	is great!
