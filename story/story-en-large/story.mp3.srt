1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Funtime Kids

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The best use of time

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The person who makes the best use of time

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
gets good results with time

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This is what happened when Sonu and Vani's

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
annual exams were about to come

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hey, are you still studying?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Come, let's eat

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Only a small project is left

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If we don't do it, the teacher will scold us

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And the exams are starting from next week

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Vani was a very hardworking

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and a good use of time kid

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Whereas her brother Sonu

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
was a very careless and naughty kid

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
He used to postpone everything

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Is your project done?

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yes, the project has to be done

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
in the 6th period

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There are still 2 periods left

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I will do it quickly

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Now come fast, I am hungry

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And I have to play too

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hey Sonu, wait

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
If you don't do it, the teacher will scold you

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Sonu and Vani's parents

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
always used to give Sonu

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
an example of Vani and make him understand

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Look Sonu, you have grown up now

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Along with playing, you should

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
also concentrate on your studies

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yes mummy, from tomorrow for sure

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Sonu, learn to make good use of time

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
from your sister

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Look, she studies with time

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
She plays with time

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
She never postpones today's work

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
for tomorrow

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You see, from tomorrow

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I will also do the same

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Shall I go and play now?

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Please!

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Sonu's carelessness was increasing

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
day by day

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And finally

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
the days of the exams

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
were nearing

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Only 2 days were left

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
for Sonu and Vani's exams

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Listen, from next Monday

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
your exams are starting

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
right?

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Study hard

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and do well in the exams

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Sonu, I am

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
really worried about you

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You always postpone

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
today's work for tomorrow

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Don't postpone your studies for tomorrow

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Like Vani,

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
study all the lessons on time

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay?

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Papa, there are still 2 days

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
left for the exams

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I will study everything

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I am going to play now

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Till I don't play

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I won't be able to study

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Vani, look

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
what a beautiful weather

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Come, let's play

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
for a while

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We can study later

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Everything will be done soon

75
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes, the weather is beautiful

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But I have to

77
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
complete my lessons

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Tomorrow is the exams

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Playing in this weather

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
is something else

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You keep studying

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I am going to play

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
After a while, Vani saw

84
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
that the beautiful weather

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
is slowly taking the form of a storm

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And the dark clouds

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
are swirling

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This can happen anytime

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Seeing the weather

90
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Vani was worried

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
that if it rains

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
how will she complete her lessons

93
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Because in the rains

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
the electricity of the house

95
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
is cut off

96
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
She called out to Sonu

97
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Sonu, listen

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It looks like it's going to rain

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Maybe the electricity will be cut off at night

100
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Stop playing and

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
come and complete your lessons

102
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What will you write to me?

103
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Don't worry, Vani

104
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's afternoon now

105
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I will finish everything

106
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
at night

107
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The electricity won't be cut off

108
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It will be fun to study

109
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
after the rain

110
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I am going now

111
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Sonu played till late evening

112
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But she was worried

113
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
when the rain started

114
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Sonu got scared

115
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and returned home

116
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
She saw that

117
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
there was no electricity

118
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
in the entire village

119
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Seeing this

120
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Sonu started crying

121
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What will happen to me

122
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
in the exam tomorrow?

123
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I didn't study a single lesson

124
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And now there is no electricity

125
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I will fail

126
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I told you

127
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
to study your lessons

128
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
on time

129
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I told you a week ago

130
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
to study on time

131
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But you never understood

132
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Now suffer

133
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Sorry, Papa

134
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What do I do now?

135
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I wish

136
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I had studied my lessons

137
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
on time

138
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
She understood

139
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
that because of her carelessness

140
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
she didn't have time to study

141
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Crying won't help

142
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Now do you understand

143
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
why everyone used to explain you?

144
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Now stop crying

145
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and come with me

146
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I had completed my studies

147
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
on time

148
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I will teach you all the lessons

149
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and remind you

150
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The next day

151
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
both the children went to the exam

152
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The one who respects time

153
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
in the future

154
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
is great!
